# [Sample Repo] PR Practice
A sample repo for practicing how to create Pull Requests

#Summary
This is a short summary on creating PRs. Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.
